#### A lightweight json data generator, transformator and validator.
This library can output random data from a Json Schema, either using standar types like String, Number, Date, Boolean, Array, Object as with the 30+ built in custom types like Name, Age, Address, Word, Sentence, paragraph, gender, (RGB) color etc.
The build int custom types are mostly provided by the module [Chance][Chance] but the library also allows you to create your own custom types.
